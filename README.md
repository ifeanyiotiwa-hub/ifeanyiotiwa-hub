### Hi there ðŸ‘‹




I'm a Java Backend Engineer and I love solving problems with code.

I enjoy discussions revolving around how tech is solving both simple and complex problems and rapidly changing the world around us.

After a long day of code I like to unwind by watching anime and reading about the latest developments in tech.
